Read me:
- Sometimes the film DAO will break stating that ResultSet cannot be resolved. To fix this delete the line importing jdbc, save, and then undo and save.
 - This may be caused by having VS Code and Eclipse open at the same time, but I am unable to confirm this.

To do:
- GetFilmByID JSON
- Improve front-end
- CSV all
- XML all
- Delete request
- Update request
- Fetching by CSV and XML
